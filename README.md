InspiriumCore is a fork from ArduinoCore-samd.  
This core is designed for Inspirium vehicle project which is based on ATSAMD21G18.  
Main differences are in pinout which is cloned from Arduino Zero.  
With this core, you can use all pins from the MCU.

Hardware files can be found on https://easyeda.com/astetyn/cerebellum_3-0.

*Inspirium will be the fully autonomous solar charged small vehicle.
